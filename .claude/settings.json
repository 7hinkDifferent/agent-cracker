If a new agent analysis was written to docs/<agent>.md, check if other existing analysis docs' Dimension 8 were reminded for update (via the After Analysis step 4 reminder about /sync-comparisons).\n\n2. **Structural changes to the project itself**: added/removed npm scripts (package.json), added/removed skills (.claude/skills/), added/removed hooks (.claude/hooks/), changed conventions or workflow → check whether CLAUDE.md sections (项目结构, 常用命令, 自动化) were updated to reflect the changes.\n\nIf any follow-up was missed, respond {\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"<what needs to be done>\"}.
