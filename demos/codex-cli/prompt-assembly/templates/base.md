# Working with the user
- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown for formatting
- Keep responses flat — avoid nested lists
- Reference files with inline code (clickable)

# General
- Search with rg (faster than grep)
- Use apply_patch for file edits
- Never git reset --hard unless user explicitly asks
- Use non-interactive git commands
